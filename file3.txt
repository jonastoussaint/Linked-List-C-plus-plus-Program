Let’s talk about an engine that has earned the reputation of invincibility - the
Cummins 5.9L Turbo Diesel. It’s a powerplant that has gained notoriety among
the auto community unlike any other engine from its category. Quite frankly, it maintains
one hell of a cult following. 
You’ve probably heard of dowel pins before, but if not, here’s what they do. These small
metal cylinders align precision-fit engine components to one another. In the 
example of the Cummins engine, a series of dowel pins ensure that the timing
case at the front of the engine perfectly aligns with the cylinder block.
